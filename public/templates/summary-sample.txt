Climate Change Effects on Ocean Life

Climate change is having profound effects on marine ecosystems around the world. Rising ocean temperatures are causing coral reefs to bleach and die, threatening the biodiversity that depends on these underwater ecosystems. Many marine species are migrating to cooler waters, disrupting food chains and affecting fishing industries.

Ocean acidification, caused by increased carbon dioxide absorption, is making it difficult for shellfish and other marine organisms to build their shells and skeletons. This has serious implications for the entire marine food web.

Additionally, sea level rise is destroying coastal habitats where many species breed and feed. Mangrove forests and salt marshes, which serve as nurseries for fish and protect coastlines, are particularly vulnerable.

Scientists warn that without immediate action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, these changes will accelerate, leading to mass extinctions in the ocean. The health of our oceans is directly linked to the health of our planet, and protecting marine ecosystems is crucial for maintaining global biodiversity.
